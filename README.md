## How to set things up
- First of all, sorry if things are a bit messy! I did this all in colab cause I bought some sweet GPU time
- I have secrets in my notebook for my huggingface and namesor API keys, so go to the secrets bar in the left and set them or just hardcode in your own notebook
- I did some wonky stuff for the riveter download check out their repo link: https://github.com/maartensap/riveter-nlp
